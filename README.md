 Display popular movies with using API [The Movie DB](https://www.themoviedb.org).  
 
 You can view upcoming movies in a handy slider block. (`Swiper React Components`)  
 Search for the movie you are interested in by title using the search bar. 
 Full information about the film on an individual page with the opportunity to get acquainted with the cast in a separate section. (`react-router`).  
 
 In this project I mastered:
 - React
 - react-create-app 
 - react-router
 - custom HTTP Hook react
 - react Bootstrap 
 - Swiper React Components
 
 All components are in the `src` folder. All another files was generated by `react-create-app`
